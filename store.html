<h1>Factory Shoe is a Canadian owned company that started in the footwear business in London, Ontario, in 1983. Since our inception, Factory Shoe has grown to a chain of four stores and two warehouses, handling almost every type of footwear available.</h1>
<p>These shoes are so pretty! The perfect color for summer and goes with any outfit. The adjustable shoe straps have a Velcro closure so you really get the perfect fit. They are very comfortable to walk in. I'm always on the lookout for the most comfortable walking shoe for summer... and I think this Dansko sandal fits the bill  - 5/2/18<p>
